## 2026-03-14 — Three-prompt character creation (Origin / Race / Class)

- Updated master design doc: character system now has four layers instead of three
- Origin (Origins++ defaults) is now the first selection prompt — species-level identity
- Race (7 custom icraft races) is the second prompt — stat modifiers and thematic flavor
- Class (10 icraft combat roles) is the third prompt — combat role and glass cannon status
- This three-layer approach emerged from in-game testing and creates more build diversity
- Re-enabled the default Origins layer to allow Origins++ origin selection
- Updated wiki classes/overview.md to reflect the new structure
