## 2026-03-19 — Alpha distribution, dedicated server fixes, loot rebalance

### Server Distribution
- `iridescentserver.bat`: Added `cd /d %~dp0` to fix working directory issues
- Paxi Forge 4.0 loads datapacks from `config/paxi/datapacks/`, NOT `global_packs/required_data/` on dedicated servers. All 17 datapacks synced there.
- Phase 0 standalone download checks both `config/` and `global_packs/`
- Mod download only runs on first install (fewer than 50 JARs)
- `.gitignore` exceptions added for `config/paxi/datapacks/*.zip`
- `max-tick-time=-1` for modded server stability
- `online-mode=false` for alpha testing (production copy preserved)

### Client Distribution
- `iridescentcraft.bat`: downloads PrismLauncher, creates instance, downloads mods
- Instance uses `%AppData%\PrismLauncher` (no portable mode)
- `instance.cfg` has `ManagedPack=true` with `[General]` header
- Mods go at instance root `mods/`, configs in `.minecraft/`

### Mod Removals
- Cherry Village removed (unregistered worldgen feature crash). Added to strip/skip lists.
- Gods & Heroes RPG Classes `.pw.toml` removed (was being re-downloaded, injecting broken class origins)

### Origin Layers Fix
- Added `order` field (0, 1, 2) and `enabled: true` to all three layer JSONs
- Added `name` and `gui_title` to Origin layer override
- All three prompts (Origin → Race → Class) confirmed working on dedicated server

### Translations (185+ entries)
- 72 custom KubeJS item translations (tokens, boss materials, alloys, rings, endgame, MekaSuit Mk2, planetary elements)
- 29 custom enchantment translations (icraft namespace)
- 440 Apotheosis affix translations covering all key formats (.suf/.suffix/.pre/.prefix/bare)
- Gender layer translation (server-only mod needs client lang)

### Loot Rebalance
- Enchanted books: no longer globally removed. Scaled by dimension (7.5% OW → 15% End) with tier-appropriate enchant levels.
- Ars Nouveau spell books: Novice (OW 5%), Apprentice (T2 5%), Archmage (T3 3%, End 5%)
- Village smith chests: 20% artifact chance (8 starter artifacts at 2.5% each)
- Ocean structures: heavily oceanic-themed (snorkel/flippers 15%, fishing rods, heart of the sea)
- Towers of the Wild: ~12% per artifact type
- Village affix gear: epic+ rarity stripped, white/green only
- Magic materials: Iron's Spells inks and Ars source gems boosted in structure chests

### Datapacks
- 17 datapacks synced to `config/paxi/datapacks/` across all distributions
- Added: Towers of the Wild, ScalingHealth NoCrystalDrops, Infinity Ham Blocker, fix_stone_tags, keepinventory, BOP biome weights (cherry blossom 8x boost)

### KubeJS Optimization Audit
- 17 tick-based scripts audited — all properly gated with interval checks
- `codex_delivery.js` and `skill_effects.js` identified as most active but efficiently structured
- `AStageEvents.added` in milestone_detection.js flagged as potential issue (listed as unavailable in wiki)

## 2026-03-17 (session 2) — Server distribution testing, mod removals, bug fixes

### Mod Removals
- Connected Glass, Trash Cans, SuperMartijn642's Core Lib + Config Lib removed — Core Lib load order incompatibility cascaded to all dependents. All `.pw.toml` metadata deleted from pack.

### Server Distribution
- Unified `iridescentserver.bat` replaces separate install + start scripts. Auto-detects first run, installs Forge, downloads mods, strips client-only/crash mods, launches server, generates crash logs on failure.
- Added `mods/.index/` (452 `.pw.toml` files) to server distribution — was missing, causing installer to fail.
- `strip_client_mods.bat` audited — no false positives across all 30 patterns.
- Server mod channel mismatch tracker: 5 mods resolved (Decorative LGBT Wall Flags, Alex's Mobs EXTRA Music, Rechiseled + SuperMartijn642 + Connected Glass + Trash Cans).

### Bug Fixes
- Duplicate origin definitions: 17 origin JSONs + layer file existed in both `kubejs/data/` and Paxi datapacks. Caused malformed second class prompt on dedicated server. Removed KubeJS copies.
- `botania:lexicon` misclassified as Patchouli book in `codex_delivery.js`. Generated malformed `/clear` command every second on login, causing connection timeout on dedicated server (silent on single player). Moved to `OTHER_BOOKS_TO_CLEAR`.

- Disenchanting Table recipe gated to T2 (requires 4x `thermal:steel_ingot`)
- Table of Experience recipe gated to T2 (requires 4x `thermal:steel_ingot`)
